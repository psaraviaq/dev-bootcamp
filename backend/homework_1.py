# Book Records
# Problem Statement:
# You are building a simple library management system where each book is represented by a record containing 
# its title, author, and ISBN number. Since these details about a book should not change once they are set, 
# you should use tuples to store this information.

# Your task is to write a function that accepts a list of book records 
# and a specific authorâ€™s name, and then returns a list of all book titles by that author.

# "The Great Gatsby", "F. Scott Fitzgerald", "9780743273565",
# "To Kill a Mockingbird", "Harper Lee", "9780061120084",
# "1984", "George Orwell", "9780451524935",
# "Animal Farm", "George Orwell", "9780451526342",
# "The Catcher in the Rye", "J.D. Salinger", "9780316769488"
